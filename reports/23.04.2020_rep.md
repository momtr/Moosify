## Topic - Moosify
We want to create a webapplication which uses the Spotify Web API to recommend songs based on the users mood which he states when opening the page as well as implementing a mood diagram based on the users "mood history".
Link to the web app: [Moosify](https://moosify.herokuapp.com/)

## Date

## Topics worked on
- switched back to free heroku version (instead of hobby)
- getting familiar with the new environment setup (vs code --> github --> heroku)
- Authentication process

## Achieved 
 - gained knowledge about redirecting (app.get, app.use, middleware etc.)
 - redirecting to Spotify if one requests the .../redirect url
 - collaborating in visual studio code


## Problems with
 - Redirecting, as react.js is a single page application. We had to figure out how to make a GET request.
 - GitHub and Heroku apparently had issues while we worked and that's why it sometimes didn't push or deploy correctly.
 
## Next steps
- more frontend development
- UI design
- Finishing the authentication process
- creating our database and pushing user data on it

## How was the lesson 
 + We all gained knowledge regarding redirects and react(single page app) and also already implemented some crucial basic functions for our app
